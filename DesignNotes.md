APPLICATION NAME: FREDERICK

AUTHOR: Jesse Thomas (jesse.thomas.jkibbels@gmail.com)

DESCRIPTION:    Frederick is being designed to be an open source Discord bot tool for the general public to be able to use and link other things up with. While this is not a new idea, it is being designed with
                the Computer Science Student Association club's idealogies in mind for my upcoming semester. The general idea for this bot is to be used as a tool alongside other tools created in the future for
                The CSSA and other clubs as well - to make The CSSA a better medium for campus connections. Please note that this file is /not/ the final image of the product as it is the personal notes of the
                author and not to be confused with the readme.md - these are two separate files. 

Overlay:
    FREDERICK:
        User authentication:
            desc:   Authenticate users with The CSSA database for streamlining the Discord itself (fast joining)
        Chat management:
            desc:   Live monitor the ongoing chats in Discord for any obvious heavy language that does not fit within the guidelines (defined in separate file)
        Event broadcasting:
            desc:   Integrate Frederick with live broadcasting to students emails with news and updates. *Note: For school use, it is not within the acceptable guidelines to store personal student information
                    outside of SNHU itself. To follow this, Frederick will simply connect to an already existing account (Club email, for instance) with permission of the sender (authentication required)
        Game Integration:
            desc:   Frederick will support Minecraft-Discord chat integration in the future to further connect the community into one. 
        Board QOL:
            desc:   The Board QOL - Quality of life - will feature the ability to streamline messages from club email to a given destination (by user input) to keep the board and school connected. For example, 
                    the bot will be able to connect to the club email and post updates from it into the board chat (discord, text, etc) as a general message that there is a new email. This will be configurable.
        Database:
            desc:   Frederick itself will not have a personal database but will feature the ability to connect to a database for general use. To keep security as high as possible, Frederick will intentionally
                    be limited to what it will be able to store/retrieve.
