# CSSABot
[Last updated May 03, 2022]

This is a repository for the open-source Discord bot for the CSSA Discord and community

Overview:
  "CSSABot" is a resource tool to make the life of the Computer Science Student Association at Southern New Hampshire University a little bit easier to       manage our internal resources a little easier. The bot will will contain several capabilities when it is finished. Presently, this is work in progress     and is open source for the community to view in spirit of being future developers somewhere in the field of computer science! For a look at how this       project is doing, our trello board is listed below.
