[Last updated May 19, 2022]

This is a repository for the open-source Discord bot for the CSSA Discord and community

Overview:
  "CSSABot" is being developed to be an open source tool that will be able to be used at Southern New Hampshire University as a general tool for the Computer Science Club to bridge between club board staff and club members. The tool is being developed with an abstract generalization in mind so that it can also be applied to other clubs for use and easy setup.
